    In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap 
    year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
but years divisible by 400 are leap years.
Tested years are in range 1600 â‰¤ year â‰¤ 4000.*/
